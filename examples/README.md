## Real-World Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Agency Onboarding
**Scenario:** A digital agency auditing a new client's marketing stack.
**Process:** The agency gains "Viewer" access, runs a complete Addocu audit, and generates a comprehensive report.
**Benefit:** Reduces hours of manual discovery work to minutes, immediately identifies legacy tags and outdated tracking, and provides a professional, data-backed foundation for the client relationship.

### Use Case 2: Internal Compliance
**Scenario:** An enterprise marketing team conducting a quarterly configuration review.
**Process:** The team runs an audit across all properties and compares the current setup against internal documentation and best practices.
**Benefit:** Systematically identifies configuration drift, non-compliant setups (e.g., missing dimensions), and assets that need to be cleaned up, ensuring data governance standards are met.

### Use Case 3: Migration Planning (e.g., UA to GA4)
**Scenario:** A company finalizing its migration from a legacy system to a new one.
**Process:** Addocu documents the current state of the new GA4 and GTM implementation, allowing for a clear comparison against the legacy setup to identify gaps.
**Benefit:** Provides a clear map of custom dimension requirements, conversion events needing configuration, and GTM tags that require updates to complete the migration.

## Best Practices & Data Quality

Addocu helps enforce best practices by surfacing inconsistencies.

### Naming Conventions
Quickly identify assets that don't follow established naming patterns.
* **Good:** `GA4 - Event - Purchase`, `CD - User Type`
* **Issues to Fix:** `Tag 1`, `Purchase_Event`, `purchase complete`

### Common Data Quality Issues Revealed
* **Missing Conversions:** Identify gaps where key user actions (e.g., form submissions, newsletter signups) are not configured as conversion events in GA4.
* **Duplicate Tracking:** Easily spot redundant tags, such as multiple GA4 configuration tags firing on the same pages.
* **Broken Data Sources:** Find Looker Studio reports connected to outdated or inaccessible Google Sheets or GA4 properties.

## Advanced Usage

### Agency Workflow (Multi-Client Management)
Use separate Google Sheets for each client to keep audits isolated and organized. The Add-on is installed once on the agency's account and can be run on any sheet.

### Recommended Audit Schedule
* **Monthly:** For a regular health check.
* **Quarterly:** For a comprehensive review and cleanup.
* **On-Demand:** Before major migrations or after significant website changes.
